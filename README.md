# BlackBook
A "for fun" project for logging information; meant as a learning experience.

The idea behind this project is a effectively a database you enter different things into that apply to your life (calendar, grocery list, etc). Via a server backend, anyone registered to the same account can access the database for their "family" (account) and get updates in real time via websockets. This is intended to be accessed on the go, so while we are starting with a Qt desktop application, we will eventually expand to Android (or who knows, maybe Fuscia will be out by the time we get around to this) and iOS.

The intention of this project is meant to be a collaborative learning experience between friends. Right now, it has almost nothing in it; there barely exists a calendar view and there is no server back-end. Since this is a hobby project being done on the side, this will probably be a slow process; it's a learning experience for us.
